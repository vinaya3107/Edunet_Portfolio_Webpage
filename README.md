# CodeAlpha-Internship-webdevelopment

Welcome to my Web Development Internship Portfolio! This portfolio showcases three projects I have developed during my internship, demonstrating my skills in web development.

Projects
1. Expense Tracker
The Expense Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their expenses. Users can add, edit, and delete expenses, and the application calculates and displays the total amount spent. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Social Media Dashboard
The Social Media Dashboard is a dashboard interface for managing social media accounts. It provides analytics, scheduling, and engagement features for multiple social media platforms. The project utilizes front-end frameworks like React.js and back-end technologies like Node.js and MongoDB for data storage.


3. Portfolio Page
The Portfolio Page is a personal website that showcases my work, skills, and achievements as a web developer. It includes a portfolio section with project highlights, an about me section, and contact information. The page is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
